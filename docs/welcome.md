# Introduction

This workshop is for participants to get hands-on learning on how to use the Responsible AI dashboard to debug their machine learning model in order to improve the model's performance to be more fair, inclusive, safe & reliable, and transparent.  The workshop will cover how to use Error Analysis, Model Overview, Data Analysis and Feature Importance in end-to-end machine learning life cycles.  After completing this workshop, participant will learn best practices of using Azure Responsible AI dashboard to produce AI solution that are less harmful to society and more trustworthy.

# Topics
The topics that will be covered in this section with be:
* Error Analysis
* Model Overview
* Data Analysis
* Feature Importance

# Data
We will be using the ***Diabetes Hospital Readmission*** dataset in our classification use case.  The trained model used in this workshop classifies if a diabetic patient will be Readmitted or Not Readmitted back to a hospital in < 30 days after they have been discharged.

# Benefits
* Easy to use dashboard to debug and mitigate model issues faster
* Produce AI systems that are more reliable and trustworthy
* Useful interactive tool to make working with compliance regulations or auditors better
* Helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders to be able to understand, explain and make well information decision based on the model's outcomes and behavior

## Duration
Let's uncover the benefits of using Azure Machine Learning's **Responsible AI dashboard in 2 hour**.
