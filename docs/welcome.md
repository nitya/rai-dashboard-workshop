# Welcome Introduction

This workshop is to teach participant about Microsoft Responsible AI principles.   Participants will learn what these principles are and how to apply the concepts into practical machine learning code.  The goal of the workshop is for participants to get hands-on learning on how to  use the Responsible AI dashboard to debug the model in order to improve the model's performance to be more fair, inclusive, safe & reliable, and transparent.  The workshop will cover how to use Error Analysis, Model Overview, Data Analysis, Feature Importance,  Counterfactual/What-If, Casual analysis and Scorecard reports in their end-to-end machine learning life cycles.  After taking this course, participant will learn best practices of using Azure Responsible AI dashboard to produce AI solution that are less harmful to society and more trustworthy.

# Topics
The topics that will be covered in this section with be:
* Error Analysis
* Model Overview
* Data Analysis
* Feature Importance

# Data
We will be using the ***Diabetes Hospital Readmission*** dataset in our classification use case.  The trained model used in this workshop classifies if a diabetic patient with be Readmitted or Not Readmitted back to a hospital in < 30 days after they have be discharged.

# Benefits
* Easy to use dashboard to debug and mitigate model issues faster
* Produce AI systems that are more reliable and trustworthy
* Useful tool to make working with compliance regulations or auditors better
* Helpful for decision-maker and stakeholders to be about to understand, explain and make well information decision based on  the model's outcomes and behavior

## Duration
Let's uncover the benefits of  **Responsible AI in 1 hour**.
